- Check next and prev pointers in freelist_head

### Check_next_prev_pointers_of_free_block_at_head_of_list_3FreeBlocks
- Multiple allocations, then few frees
- Multiple free blocks in free list
- Check for pointers to the blocks
- Check values in the header and footer tags of the free blocks

### ManagingMemory_consecutive_list
- Multiple allocations then multiple frees
- Check for proper ordering of free blocks in free list

### Realloc_size_zero_expect_NULL
- Realloc call with size 0
- Expect NULL and for the errno to be set

### Realloc_smaller_size_ptr_should_not_move
- Malloc a block
- Realloc that block to a smaller size
- Check to see that the block did not move

### Realloc_larger_fits_contiguous
- Malloc a block
- Realloc larger size
- Expect block to be in same place and just extended forward

### Realloc_larger_must_move
- Malloc a few blocks
- Realloc a block to larger size
- Realloc'd block should have moved to be able to accommodate the request

### Realloc_larger_fits_contiguous_absorb_splinter
- Malloc a few blocks
- Free a block
- Realloc block such that it extends forward but has to absorb more than it needs otherwise splinter would be left

### Coalesce_no_coalescing
- Malloc a few blocks
- Free a couple of blocks that are not next to other free blocks in memory
- Then check free list for right number of blocks

### Coalesce_free_block_before
- Malloc a few blocks
- Free block and then free block right after that one
- Check free list to make sure its been properly coalesced

### Coalesce_free_block_after
- Malloc a few blocks
- Free a block and then free another block before that one
- Check free list to make sure its been properly coalesced

### Coalesce_free_before_and_after
- Malloc a few blocks
- Free two blocks, that are not next to each other, just one block apart from one another
- Free the block in the middle of two free blocks
- Check the free list to see that it was properly coalesced

### Malloc_one_page
- Malloc an entire page
- Check allocated block for proper header and footer tags
- Check for empty free list

### Malloc_two_pages
- Malloc two pages
- Check allocated block for proper header and footer tags
- Check for empty free list

### Malloc_three_pages
- Malloc three pages
- Check allocated block for proper header and footer tags
- Check for empty free list

### Malloc_four_pages
- Malloc four pages
- Check allocated block for proper header and footer tags
- Check for empty free list

### Splinter
- Malloc a few times
- Free a small block
- Then Malloc call which will attempt to split that recently freed block but if split would leave splinter so it should give the entire block

### Splitting
- Malloc a few times
- Then free a large block
- Malloc for a small block, so that it splits on the recently freed block
- Check the free list head to make sure block was properly  split and put back into free list

### Info_count_allocations
- Malloc and free a few times
- Then call sf_info and check allocations count

### Info_count_coalesces
- Malloc and free a few times
- Then call sf_info and check the coalesces count

### Info_count_internal
- Malloc and free a few times
- Then call sf_info and check the internal count

### Info_count_external
- Malloc and free a few times
- Then call sf_info and check the external count

### Info_Malloc_And_Free
- Malloc and free a few times
- Check block size and padding size of an allocated block
- Check freelist_head block size
- Call sf_info and check allocations, frees, internal, and external counts

### Realloc_Payload_Integrity_And_Moved
- Malloc a couple of times
- Copy a string into an allocated block
- Realloc the allocated block such that it needs to be moved to do the re-allocation
- Then check for the string in the payload to make sure the payload was copied over

### Realloc_Both_Extend_In_Place_And_Move
- Malloc a few times
- Realloc twice such that the block needs to be moved to a different address on the heap to accommodate the request
- Realloc on a block such that it does not have to be moved to accommodate the request

### Free_Coalesce_Forward_2_Times
- Malloc a few times
- Free 3 blocks that are located one after another in memory
- Check the freelist_head to see if the blocks freed were properly coalesced and check freelist_head footer tag as well
- Check to see that the rest of the page that is free is in the free list

### Malloc_Whole_First_Page_Multiple_Times
- Malloc whole page in one malloc call
- Check for empty free list
- Then free the page and malloc the entire page again with multiple malloc calls
- Check for empty list again
- Free all allocated blocks and check freelist_head block size and make sure its block size is one page (4096 bytes)
- Check that freelist_head is the only free block in the free list

### Malloc_four_pages_across_multiple_mallocs_then_frees_all
- Malloc all four pages with numerous malloc calls
- Check for empty free list
- Free all the allocated blocks
- Check freelist_head block size and make sure its four pages

### Stress Tests
- Mix of a bunch of malloc and free calls
- Check freelist_head at the end
